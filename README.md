# Technical Assessment
This is a sample python script that performs some reads from a mongo database and writes to MySQL databases.

 

Kindly perform a refactor of the code to improve its readability, functionality, supportability, error handling/exception, testing or whatever is needed.

## Optimizations

Code Improvements:
- Constants: Defined constants for configuration details to make it easier to manage and modify these values in the future.
- Function names: Changed function names to follow Python naming conventions (snake_case).
- Improved variable names: Changed variable names to be more descriptive and meaningful.
- Added comments: Included comments to explain the purpose of functions and sections of code.
- Removed unused constants: Removed some unused constants to declutter the code.
- Standardized date and time handling: Ensured consistent usage of datetime objects and date/time formatting.
- Minor code adjustments: Made some minor code formatting adjustments for better readability.
